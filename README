This build of APP includes:
docker-compose.yaml file, which used to build and run 3 containers:
1. web - nginx container for serving static files.
 (includes files directory with index.html - template file for app, js/main.js - main javascript functions).
 You need to fix server name in nginx config file before starting up the docker instance.
 
2. neo4j - neo4j database with tsi-mappings database dump, which loaded at startup.

3. api - FastApi APP which connect to neo4j database inside container. 

At this point there is no user's authentication all API endpoints freely accessible at http://localhost/ address.

To run this containers use this command as root in current directory:

docker-compose up --build

These ports: 80, 443, 7678, 7474 should be free.
